                <h6>I code with HTML, Sass and JS (ES5 and ES6). I have experience in working with TS, Angular, jQuery,
                    and
                    SVG.js.
                    Most of the time I prefer building from scratch, but have built on top of Bootstrap, Materialize and
                    Neat.
                    I also have experience in working on Django and Wagtail CMS projects.

                    Git, npm and Gulp, and have also worked on several projects where I used Webpack and Bower. Last but
                    not least, I have to admit, I am pretty freaking good at googling. <br> ¯\(ツ)/¯
