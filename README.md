# Portfolio Website 
This is my portfolio website generated and developed with Angular CLI. You can see the portfolio here: aidana.xyz
The website consists of a portfolio overview of all websites I have worked on, a game and an about me section.

## Installing dependencies

Run `npm install`.

## Development

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.
Or run `ng serve --open` to automatically open the project in your browser.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
